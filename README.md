## overview
This project contains two parts.Part 1 is about the prediction of battle result between two pokemons, while part 2 is the iamge generation using Generative Adversarial Networks<br>

## Part1
### Introduction
First we conduct data visualization feature engineering and elo-rating , then we try several classical machine learning models to predict the combat result. The models include logistical regression, SVM, KNN, Adaboost, and MLP and so on. And we plot each modelâ€™s confusion matrix, and ROC curve. <br>
### File
The file contains data and code, the data part contains combats.csv and pokemon.csv.<br> 
The code has five parts: data visualization, feature engineering, elo-rating and algorithms<br/> 
### Usage
